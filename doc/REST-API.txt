               Spreed Speak Freely REST API v1.0.0
            ===============================================
                        (c)2014 struktur AG

The server provides a REST api end point to provide functionality outside the
the channeling API or without a established web socket connection.

The REST API does always return valid JSON data. This includes the non 200
status responses. If non JSON is received this is an error not generated by the
API or there was a problem while JSON encoding.


Available end points with request methods and content-type:


  /api/v1/rooms

    The rooms end point can be used to generate new random room ids.

          "success": true,

        }
